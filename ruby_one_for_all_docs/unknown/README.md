# mathn

mathn serves to make mathematical operations more precise in Ruby and to
integrate other mathematical standard libraries.

Without mathn:

    3 / 2 => 1 # Integer

With mathn:

    3 / 2 => 3/2 # Rational

mathn keeps value in exact terms.

Without mathn:

    20 / 9 * 3 * 14 / 7 * 3 / 2 # => 18

With mathn:

    20 / 9 * 3 * 14 / 7 * 3 / 2 # => 20

When you require 'mathn', the libraries for Prime, CMath, Matrix and Vector
are also loaded.
